# Notes Components

This folder contains the main components for the simple notes application.

- `NoteList.vue`: List of all notes with actions.
- `NoteDetails.vue`: Modal for viewing a single note in detail.
- `NoteForm.vue`: Modal form for creating or editing a note.

All components use the [color palette](../assets/base.css) defined for the app and follow a modern, minimalistic light UX.
